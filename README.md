# Scout's Honor

**Best of Bloomington | Luxury Dog Care Facility**

Scout's Honor is an award-winning dog boarding, daycare, grooming, and training facility located in the historic Bender Lumber building in Downtown Bloomington, Indiana.

We are redefining pet care by moving away from simple "warehousing" of dogs to a science-backed, **enrichment-based model**. Our facility focuses on the whole dog—engaging their mind, body, and senses to ensure they leave happier and healthier than they arrived.

## About Us

Founded by Allison Jacobs and Kristen Perrus, Scout's Honor was born from a desire to create a better standard of care not just for pets, but for the people who look after them. We are proud to be the only pet care provider in Indiana starting employees at a thriving wage of **$15/hour**, fostering a dedicated team of professionals who pour their hearts into their work.

## Our Services

- **Luxury Boarding:** Private climate-controlled suites, orthopedic bedding, and nightly tuck-in services.
- **Enrichment Daycare:** Structured playgroups separated by size and temperament, focusing on mental puzzles, sensory activities, and rest cycles.
- **Fear Free® Grooming:** Spa services designed to reduce fear, anxiety, and stress.
- **Positive Reinforcement Training:** From puppy manners to advanced obedience.
